The team met via Zoom. We worked out how to screen share our game.
We will meet via Zoom at 2:45 to hammer out the last minute details, and do a sound/video check for 
our screen sharing.
We talked about the leaderboard and the prototype game. We have a web link that puts the game on a web page. That is what we
will show during the recitation.
