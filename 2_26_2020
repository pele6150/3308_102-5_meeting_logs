Discussed which tutorial videos to watch regarding Unity.
Decided we will probably need to meet on the weekend going forward. It is too hard to find a time we all can meet during the week.

Went to envatotuts+ to do basic 2d game tutorial.

Assignments:
	Matt - Began tutorial on 2d game design.
	
	Peter - Researched how to use very large files with github. No solution as of ending of meeting. Will continue to work on it.
		We may need to ask TA/Prof if there is a version control system available to CU students that handles Unity files. 

	Remy - Began tutorial on 2d game design, and also tutorial on designing game from scratch.

	Mike - Getting rundown of asset packages and will add card for each asset package so we can each grab and complete them.
	       We will work with asset package and see if would work within the scope of our game.


Agreed to meet this weekend on Sunday. A group message will be sent to finalize time and place.
