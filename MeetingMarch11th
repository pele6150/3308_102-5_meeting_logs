Remy, Peter, Matt

Talked about using Google Drive for the Unity files since github has file size limitations. We should be able to control versioning
using Google Drive.
We will use Zoom to enable us to meet more regularly during the week.
We need to meet next Thursday before recitation to firm up our prototype for Chelsea.
This week 
Everyone should be fully familiar with Unity by the TA group meeting check-in.
We started working on the scoreboard. Have an HTML file pushed to git.
