Hey guys, so at our meeting today we were talking about maybe making a concerted effort to work on our Unity
fundamentals (since Mike seems to be the only one with any real experience with the program). We talked about
the core of a 2D platformer and we feel that this basically consists of movement, animation, and interaction
between the player-character and the world. To work on these fundamentals and move forward with the project,
while also getting a better feel for Unity, we proposed that we should all independently follow the video
tutorials (included below), and meet back again next week to compared our "finished" products. From there we
can proceed with the more complex parts of the project (including level design, original animation, and unique
mechanics), and more efficiently delegate tasks based off of what people are comfortable with.

Ideally, we should each be able to show a small, single-screen area where the player-character is jumping around
and demonstrating collision with the environments (as can be seen at the very start of the ANIMATION video included
below). Feel free to provide feedback if this seems appropriate, or if we should adjust this goal in some way. Also
feel free to download different animation packages from each other so we can have different looking "games". This
could help us figure out what kind of artstyle we want for the final game.
