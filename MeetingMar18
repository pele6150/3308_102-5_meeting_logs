Steve Jobs Rejected Interns
We met via Zoom to talk over the state of the project. We are going have at least one meeting tomorrow,
one hour before the Zoom recitation, to go over last minute items.
We will show two working modules of our project. One is the leaderboard HTML webpage. The other is a quick
demo of our game as it is now.
Actions:
Pete is continuing work on the HTML page. Matt and Pete will continue to work on the interface between the
player/score database and the web front-end.
Remy is continuing with the game level. He is trying to figure out a problem with the ground collision part
of the game.
Mike is working on the animation and the artwork for the game.
Chris is working is also working on art work, and also working on advanced collision physics for the game.
